Recommender Systems:
>Have set of ratings each user gives to movies
>Some movies may not have been rated by them yet
>Want to fill in missing 'unrated' movies with predicted ratings for that user
>r(i,j) is 1 if user j has rated movie i, else 0
>y(i,j) is rating user j gives movie i

(1) Content-based Recommendation:
>Can use features e.g. x1 (romance), x2 (action)
>Each film has a number for x1, x2, i.e. feature vector
>Have diff parameter vector theta(j) for each user j
>Lin Reg for each user to predict ratings for unrated films
>min(theta(j)){ 1/2m(j) * sum(i=1:r(i,j)=1)[ { theta(j)'.X(i) - y(i,j) }^2 ]   + 1/2m(j) * sum(k=1:n){ theta(j)k ^2 }
>where m(j) is number of films rated by user j
>Can run this over all j, i.e. min(theta(1), ..., theta(n)){ sum(j=1:n){...} }
>Gradient descent: d/dtheta(j)k { J(theta(1),...,theta(n)) }
>See notes for full eqn

(2) Collaborative Filtering:
>Alternative option to content-based, is v hard to specify x1, x2 (romance, action) for a movie
>Assume x1, x2 are unknown
>Suppose instead that each user tells us how much they like action vs romance
>This gives us our theta vectors
>Can use this, along with their ratings for individual movies, to infer x1, x2 for a movie
>Formalising this, want to minimise cost w.r.t. x(i)

Content-based vs. Collaborative Filtering:
>Given x(1),...,x(nm) can estimate theta(1),...,theta(nu)
>Given theta(1),...,theta(nu) can estimate x(1),...,x(nm)
>Can randomly guess theta then use to predict x
>Guess theta -> x -> theta -> x ...
>Converges to reasonable set of features for movies and param for users

(3) Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
>More efficient algorithm of above that does not req iteration and can solve simultaneously
>Combined optimisation objective
>Write J as function of x and theta
>New J includes squared dist term and both regularisation terms
>This process required x c (n x 1), not n+1 and theta c (n x n), i.e. x0 =/= 1

>X AND THETA INITIALISE W RANDOM VARIABLES - ENSURES SYMMETRY BREAKING I.E. ALL X(I) DONT CONVERGE TO SAME VALUE
