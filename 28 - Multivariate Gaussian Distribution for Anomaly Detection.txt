Multivariate Gaussian Distribution:
>Previous method considers only distance from average, for each features
>This results in ~circular contours for p(x) as we move away from cluster
>But suppose we have a linear relationship between x1 and x2
>A pt could clearly deviate from line but still be within acceptable region for x1 & x2

>We model p(x) all in one go
>Take mu (n x 1), sigma (n x n) <- covariance
>Use eqn for Multivariate Gaussian Distr.
>Varying elements of sigma changes form/direction of gaussian distr.

>MUTLIVARIATE GAUSSIAN DISTR IS MORE GENERAL CASE OF PREV EXAMPLE
>Previous example is where sigma is diagonal matrix of variances
>[sigma1^2, 0, ..., 0; 0, sigma2^2, 0, ..., 0; 0, 0, sigma3^2, ... 0; ...]
>Computing sigma computationally expensive
>For multivariate gaussian must have m (#examples) > n (#features) (m >> 10n is good) or else sigma is non-invertible
>Redundant features (e.g. x3 = x1 + x2) i.e. linearly dependent will make sigma non-invertible
