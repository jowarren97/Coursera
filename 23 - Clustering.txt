Unsupervised Learning:
>Find structure in data-set WITHOUT labels

Clustering:
>Good for market segmentation, social network analysis, astronomical data analysis

K-means Algorithm (most popular clustering algorithm):
>Assign data pts to randomly initialist closest cluster centroid
>Move cluster centroids to centres of new clusters
>Repeat until centroids do not change position

Random Initialisation:
>Should have K < m
>Randomly pick K training examples, set mu1,...,muk equal to these K examples
>Can converge to different solutions (different local optima of J)
>To counter this, repeat lots of different random initialisations
>Pick clustering with lowest cost

Choosing the Number of Clusters:
>Elbow method: plot J vs K (no. of clusters); gives \_ shape
>Take 'elbow' or sharp bend as no. of clusters to use
>Doesn't always have clear elbow
>Can also preselect K if we have downstream purpose e.g. sizing of T shirts need 3 (S, M, L)
