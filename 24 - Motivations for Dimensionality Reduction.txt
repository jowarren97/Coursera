Data Compression:
>Reduce dimensions by projecting onto new axes
>Allows algorithms to run more quickly

Data Visualisation:
>Can reduce dimensions to clarify variation between data pts
>e.g Countries classified by 50 features, reduce to 2 or 3 which roughly correspond to country size and GDP per person
