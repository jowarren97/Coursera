uses of machine learning:
>database mining e.g web click data, human genome
>applications can't program by hand e.g computer vision, language processing
>self-customizing programs e.g product rec
>understanding human learning

what is machine learning?
>ability to learn w/o being explicitly programmed
>ability can exceed programmer
>a computer program is said to learn from experience E wrt task T & perf measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E

machine learning algorithms:
>supervised
>unsupervised
>reinforcement
>recommender systems

supervised learning:
>give dataset and correct answers
>regression problem = map input to cont value output
>classification problem = map input to discrete value output i.e group
>ideally want alg that can take in inf # input features (SVM)

unsupervised learning
>dont know correct groupings/results
>clustering to derive structure of data
>e.g market segmentation, social network analysis
>e.g cocktail party, separating speech from noisy background
